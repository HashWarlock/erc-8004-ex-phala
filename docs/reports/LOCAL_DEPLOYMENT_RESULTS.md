# Local Deployment Test Results

**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Environment**: Production TEE (Real Hardware)
**Status**: ✅ All Tests Passed (3/3)

## Test Results

| Test | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Server Agent Deployment | ✅ PASS | Full lifecycle tested |
| Validator Agent Deployment | ✅ PASS | Successfully deployed |
| Multi-Agent Scenario | ✅ PASS | Multiple agents coexist |

## Server Agent Deployment

### Configuration
```
Domain: server-agent.test.phala.network
Role: server
Chain ID: 84532
TEE Mode: true
RPC: https://sepolia.base.org
```

### Results
- **Address**: `0x9979E31E0a53300E05762DFF87c69e5db77787bf`
- **Attestation**: ✓ 10,020 bytes received
- **Status**: Created and configured
- **Capabilities**: Agent status API working

### Lifecycle Tested
1. ✅ Configuration loaded from environment
2. ✅ TEE client initialized at `/var/run/dstack.sock`
3. ✅ Key derived from TEE (deterministic)
4. ✅ Agent initialized with proper role
5. ✅ TEE attestation generated
6. ✅ Status API functional

## Validator Agent Deployment

### Configuration
```
Domain: validator-agent.test.phala.network
Role: validator
Chain ID: 84532
TEE Mode: true
```

### Results
- **Address**: `0x70137422633AB6fa0f009f3c7B232C4C891d24fD`
- **Attestation**: ✓ 10,020 bytes received
- **Status**: Validation rules configured
- **Lifecycle**: Complete

### Validation Setup
- ✅ Validation rules configured
- ✅ TEE-secured validation logic ready
- ✅ Different address from server (unique per domain+salt)

## Multi-Agent Scenario

### Tested Configuration
- Server Agent + Validator Agent running concurrently
- Same TEE environment
- Different domains and salts

### Key Findings
```
Server address:    0x9979E31E0a53300E05762DFF87c69e5db77787bf
Validator address: 0x70137422633AB6fa0f009f3c7B232C4C891d24fD
Addresses unique: True ✓
```

### Verified
- ✅ Multiple agents can be deployed in same TEE
- ✅ Each agent gets unique TEE-derived address
- ✅ Domain + salt combination ensures uniqueness
- ✅ No conflicts between agents

**Sample Report**:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-01T00:04:52.547388",
  "agent_type": "server",
  "domain": "server-agent.test.phala.network",
  "address": "0x9979E31E0a53300E05762DFF87c69e5db77787bf",
  "salt": "test-deployment-1759248292.165402",
  "tee_mode": true,
  "chain_id": 84532,
  "attestation_received": true,
  "status": {
    "domain": "server-agent.test.phala.network",
    "role": "server",
    "is_registered": false,
    "agent_id": null,

  }
}
```

## What Was Tested

### Agent Creation
- ✅ AgentConfig initialization
- ✅ RegistryAddresses configuration
- ✅ Agent factory pattern (create_agent)
- ✅ Template-specific initialization (ServerAgent, ValidatorAgent)

### TEE Integration
- ✅ DstackClient connection to `/var/run/dstack.sock`
- ✅ Key derivation via `get_key()` + `decode_key()`
- ✅ Attestation generation with 64-byte application data
- ✅ Deterministic address generation

### Agent Capabilities
- ✅ Status API (`get_status()`)
- ✅ Address derivation (`_get_agent_address()`)
- ✅ Attestation retrieval (`get_attestation()`)
- ✅ Role-specific configuration

## What Was NOT Tested

❌ **Blockchain registration** - Would require:
  - Actual transaction signing
  - Gas payment
  - Contract deployment verification
  - On-chain state changes

❌ **Full task processing** - Would require:
  - Implementing abstract `process_task()` method
  - External API calls
  - AI provider integration

❌ **Agent-to-agent communication** - Would require:
  - Network endpoints
  - Message passing
  - Reputation feedback loops

## Next Steps for Full Deployment

### 1. Blockchain Registration
```python
# Register agent on-chain (requires funds)
agent_id = await agent.register()
```

Requirements:
- ETH/gas on Base Sepolia for transactions
- Registry contracts deployed and accessible
- Web3 provider connection working

### 2. Task Processing Implementation
```python
# Implement in derived class
async def process_task(self, task_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Your agent logic here
    return result
```

### 3. Multi-Agent Communication
- Set up network endpoints
- Implement task submission between agents
- Test reputation and validation flows

## Performance Metrics

**Deployment Speed**:
- Agent creation: < 1 second
- TEE key derivation: < 1 second
- Attestation generation: < 1 second
- Total deployment: < 3 seconds per agent

**Resource Usage**:
- Memory: Minimal (agent objects are lightweight)
- CPU: Low (TEE operations are efficient)
- Network: None (local testing only)

## Conclusion

✅ **Local deployment is fully functional** in production TEE environment

The SDK successfully:
- Creates agents with TEE security
- Derives unique addresses deterministically
- Generates real TEE attestations
- Supports multiple agent types
- Enables multi-agent scenarios

**Ready for**: Testing individual agent components and logic
**Not ready for**: Full on-chain deployment (requires blockchain funding and testing)
