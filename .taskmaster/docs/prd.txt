# Overview
The ERC-8004 Trustless Agents Example with Phala Network integration demonstrates how AI agents can interact trustlessly across organizational boundaries using the ERC-8004 registry system. This implementation extends the standard example by integrating Phala Network's TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) capabilities for enhanced privacy and security in agent interactions. The project showcases decentralized AI collaboration with confidential computing, enabling agents to perform sensitive operations while maintaining transparency through blockchain audit trails.
