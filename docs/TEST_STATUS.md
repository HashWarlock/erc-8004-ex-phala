  - Public key attestation

### ⚠️ Failing Tests

#### Contract Integration Tests (2/5)
- `tests/integration/test_contracts.py` - 3 failures
  - ❌ Agent registration - Contract error `0xe93ba223`
  - ❌ Feedback authorization - Contract error `0xe93ba223`
  - ❌ Validation request - Contract error `0xe93ba223`
  - ✅ Registration fee check

## Recent Fixes Applied

### SDK Migration (Completed)
- Migrated from deprecated `TappdClient` to `DstackClient`
- Updated method calls:
  - `derive_key()` → `get_key()` for deterministic secp256k1 keys
  - `tdx_quote()` → `get_quote()` for attestation quotes
- Fixed socket path: `tappd.sock` → `dstack.sock` (dstack OS 0.5.x)

### Test Assertion Fixes
- Fixed certificate_chain assertions (it's a list, not a string)
- Updated key consistency tests to match new API behavior
- Corrected quote generation to use bytes instead of string + hash_algo

### Developer Experience Improvements
- Flox environment auto-sets `DSTACK_SIMULATOR_ENDPOINT`
- Shows TEE simulator status on shell activation
- No manual socket path configuration needed

## Environment Configuration

### Flox Auto-Configuration
```bash
# Automatically set on `flox activate`:
DSTACK_SIMULATOR_ENDPOINT=/path/to/.dstack/sdk/simulator/dstack.sock
```

### TEE Simulator Commands
```bash
make tee-setup   # Build simulator from source
make tee-start   # Start TEE simulator
make tee-status  # Check simulator status
make tee-test    # Run TEE tests
```

## Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test suites
make test-unit    # Unit tests only
make test-int     # Integration tests
make test-tee     # TEE simulator tests
make test-e2e     # End-to-end tests

# Run with coverage
make test-cov
```

## Known Issues

### Contract Test Failures
The contract integration tests are failing with error code `0xe93ba223`. This needs investigation:
- Could be related to contract deployment state
- May need to redeploy contracts
- Possible account/permission issues

### Websockets Warning
A deprecation warning from the websockets library appears but doesn't affect functionality:
```
DeprecationWarning: websockets.legacy is deprecated
```
This is from a dependency and not our code.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Contract Tests**: Investigate and resolve the `0xe93ba223` error
2. **Container Build**: Proceed with Task #8 - Flox containerization
3. **Documentation**: Update SDK usage examples with new API methods
