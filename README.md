```

1. **Google AP2 Intent Verification** (Google's Official Protocol)
   - **What it verifies:** "Did the human authorize this action?"
   - **How:** RSA256 JWT signing, cryptographic mandates, and W3C Payment Request API compliance
   - **Role:** User authorization and intent verification with enterprise-grade security
   - **Storage:** Intent IDs (`intent_*`) and Cart IDs (`cart_*`) stored on IPFS with JWT authorization tokens

2. **ChaosChain Process Integrity** (Our Innovation)
   - **What it verifies:** "Did the agent execute the correct code?"
   - **How:** Cryptographic execution proofs and code integrity checks
   - **Role:** Verifiable AI agent execution with insurance backing
   - **Storage:** Process Integrity Proofs (`proof_*`) stored on IPFS with code hashes

3. **ChaosChain Adjudication** (Our Innovation)
   - **What it verifies:** "Was the work the agent did actually good?"
   - **How:** ERC-8004 validation registry and quality assessment
   - **Role:** Outcome verification and reputation building
   - **Storage:** Validation results and reputation scores on-chain via ERC-8004

### The Complete AI Agent Lifecycle

AI agents in our ecosystem can:
1.  **Authorize:** Receive cryptographically verified user intent via AP2
2.  **Execute:** Perform tasks with verifiable process integrity
3.  **Validate:** Have their work quality assessed and proven on-chain
4.  **Settle:** Receive dual-protocol payments (AP2 authorization + x402 settlement)
5.  **Own:** Convert their verified work into new, royalty-bearing IP assets

This demo showcases the complete Triple-Verified Stack that will power the ChaosChain protocol and its future ecosystem of specialized "Studios."

1.  **Python 3.8+** with `pip` and `cryptography` library support.
2.  **API Keys & Endpoints:**
    -   A **Base Sepolia RPC URL**.
    -   An **Operator Private Key** (a fresh wallet with Base Sepolia ETH for gas and USDC for payments).
    -   A **Pinata JWT** for IPFS uploads.
    -   A **Crossmint API Key** for the Story Protocol integration.
    -   **Production Dependencies** (Google AP2, cryptography, A2A-x402 - automatically installed via requirements.txt).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ChaosChain/chaoschain-genesis-studio.git
    cd chaoschain-genesis-studio
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This will install all production dependencies including:
    - Google's official AP2 library
    - Cryptography library for RSA256 JWT signing
    - PyJWT for token handling
    - All other required packages

3.  **Test multi-payment capabilities:**
    ```bash
    # Verify W3C Payment Request API compliance
    python -c "
    from agents.chaoschain_agent_sdk import ChaosChainAgentSDK
    sdk = ChaosChainAgentSDK('TestAgent', 'test.com', 'server', 'base-sepolia', enable_ap2=True)
    methods = sdk.get_supported_payment_methods()
    print(f'✅ {len(methods)} W3C payment methods ready:')
    for method in methods:
        name = method.split('/')[-1] if '/' in method else method
        print(f'  • {name}')
    "
    ```

4.  **Configure your environment:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    cp genesis_wallets.json.example genesis_wallets.json
    ```
    Now, edit the `.env` file and add your RPC URL, private key, and API keys.
    
    **SECURITY WARNING**: Never commit `genesis_wallets.json` or any file containing private keys to Git!
    
4.  **Security Setup:**
    The system will automatically generate RSA keypairs for production-grade JWT signing on first run. Keys are stored securely in the `./keys/` directory (excluded from git).

### Run the Demo

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Fund Wallets First**

Before running the demo, you must fund the agent wallets with ETH for gas fees:

```bash
# 1. Check wallet funding status
python fix_and_run_demo.py

# 2. Fund wallets using Base Sepolia faucet
# Visit: https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-sepolia-faucet
# Fund each address shown in the funding status table

# 3. Run the demo (after funding)
python genesis_studio.py

# OR use the safe runner that checks funding first
python fix_and_run_demo.py
```

**Wallet Addresses (fund these with Base Sepolia ETH):**
- Alice: `0xB7DE5621f92e3bE0eD0c846CAa37cA7939F63b31`
- Bob: `0x5998610d644df828Aa8073f12CBb05337c8f3945`  
- Charlie: `0x4E9970f764d2908C6922C834a60E8DF99fAc0d46`

Each wallet needs at least **0.001 ETH** for gas fees.

## The Triple-Verified Stack Lifecycle in Action

The demo script executes a complete, four-phase Triple-Verified Stack workflow:

### Phase 1: Setup & Triple-Verified Stack Identity
-   Initializes secure wallets for the three agents (Alice, Bob, Charlie) using Coinbase Agent Kit.
-   Connects to the Base Sepolia testnet.
-   Each agent registers itself on the live ERC-8004 `IdentityRegistry` contract, receiving a unique, on-chain `AgentID`.
-   Agents are initialized with **Triple-Verified Stack** capabilities: AP2, ChaosChain Process Integrity, and ERC-8004 Adjudication.

### Phase 2: Triple-Verified Stack Execution
-   **Google AP2 Intent Verification:** Charlie creates cryptographic mandates using Google's official AP2 library with RSA256 JWT signing for smart shopping with specific constraints (green winter jacket, 20% premium tolerance).
-   **ChaosChain Process Integrity:** Alice performs smart shopping with verifiable execution, generating cryptographic proofs of code integrity and correct execution.
-   **A2A-x402 Dual Payment System:** Charlie authorizes payment via **Google AP2** ($2.0 USDC) and settles via **A2A-x402 extension** (1.7 USDC) with automatic protocol fee collection (2.5% to ChaosChain treasury).
-   **ChaosChain Adjudication:** Bob validates the shopping results using ERC-8004 ValidationRegistry, assessing quality against smart shopping criteria.
-   **Enhanced Evidence Packages** are created containing Google AP2 JWT proofs, process integrity proofs, A2A-x402 payment receipts, and validation results.

### Phase 3: Complete Verification Stack
-   All three verification layers are combined into a **Triple-Verified Proof Package**.
-   Evidence includes: Google AP2 JWT authorization proofs, ChaosChain process integrity proofs, A2A-x402 payment receipts, and ERC-8004 validation scores.
-   Complete audit trail demonstrates the world's first end-to-end verified AI agent transaction with production-grade security.

### Phase 4: IP Monetization Flywheel
-   Upon successful Triple-Verified Stack completion, the script triggers the ChaosChain IP monetization loop.
-   It uses the **Crossmint API** to register Alice's verified work as a new **IP Asset on Story Protocol**.
-   This action assigns ownership of the new IP to Alice's agent wallet, making it a new, potentially royalty-bearing asset backed by triple verification.

## ChaosChain Agent SDK

The ChaosChain Agent SDK provides a unified interface for developers to create agents that seamlessly integrate with the **Triple-Verified Stack** and **multi-payment system**. Any agent can use this SDK to join the world's first fully verified AI agent economy with complete W3C Payment Request API compliance.

### Multi-Payment System Usage

Our SDK supports **5 W3C-compliant payment methods** out of the box:

#### Quick Payment Method Check
```python
from agents.chaoschain_agent_sdk import ChaosChainAgentSDK

# Initialize SDK with multi-payment support
agent = ChaosChainAgentSDK(
    agent_name="MyAgent",
    agent_domain="myagent.com", 
    agent_role="server",
    network="base-sepolia",
    enable_ap2=True  # Enables all payment methods
)

# Get all supported payment methods
payment_methods = agent.get_supported_payment_methods()
print(f"Supported methods: {payment_methods}")
# Output: ['basic-card', 'https://google.com/pay', 'https://apple.com/apple-pay', 
#          'https://www.paypal.com/webapps/checkout/js', 'https://chaoschain.com/crypto-pay']
```

#### Traditional Payment Processing
```python
# Process a credit card payment
card_result = agent.execute_traditional_payment(
    payment_method="basic-card",
    amount=10.0,
    currency="USD",
    payment_data={
        "cardType": "visa",
        "cardNumber": "4111111111111111",
        "expiryMonth": "12",
        "expiryYear": "2025",
        "cardSecurityCode": "123"
    }
)
print(f"Card payment: {card_result.status} - {card_result.transaction_id}")

# Process a Google Pay payment
gpay_result = agent.execute_traditional_payment(
    payment_method="https://google.com/pay",
    amount=10.0,
    currency="USD",
    payment_data={
        "googleTransactionId": "gpay_transaction_123",
        "paymentMethodType": "CARD"
    }
)
print(f"Google Pay: {gpay_result.status} - {gpay_result.transaction_id}")

# Process an Apple Pay payment
apay_result = agent.execute_traditional_payment(
    payment_method="https://apple.com/apple-pay",
    amount=10.0,
    currency="USD",
    payment_data={
        "transactionIdentifier": "apay_transaction_123",
        "paymentMethod": {"type": "credit"}
    }
)
print(f"Apple Pay: {apay_result.status} - {apay_result.transaction_id}")
```

#### Crypto Payment Processing (A2A-x402)
```python
# Create crypto payment request
payment_request = agent.create_x402_payment_request(
    cart_id="cart_123",
    total_amount=5.0,
    currency="USDC",
    items=[{"name": "AI Service", "price": 5.0}],
    settlement_address="0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb7"
)

# Execute crypto payment
crypto_result = agent.execute_x402_crypto_payment(
    payment_request=payment_request,
    payer_agent="PayerAgent",
    service_description="AI Analysis Service"
)
print(f"Crypto payment: {crypto_result.status} - {crypto_result.transaction_hash}")
```

#### Production Integration Examples

**For E-commerce Platforms:**
```python
# Universal payment processor - handles any payment method
def process_customer_payment(payment_method, amount, currency, payment_data):
    if payment_method == "https://chaoschain.com/crypto-pay":
        # Handle crypto payments via A2A-x402
        return agent.execute_x402_crypto_payment(...)
    else:
        # Handle traditional payments (cards, wallets)
        return agent.execute_traditional_payment(
            payment_method, amount, currency, payment_data
        )
```

**For Payment Gateways:**
```python
# Payment method discovery for checkout
available_methods = agent.get_supported_payment_methods()
checkout_options = []

for method in available_methods:
    if method == "basic-card":
        checkout_options.append({
            "id": "cards",
            "name": "Credit/Debit Cards", 
            "types": ["visa", "mastercard", "amex", "discover"]
        })
    elif "google.com/pay" in method:
        checkout_options.append({
            "id": "googlepay",
            "name": "Google Pay",
            "instant": True
        })
    # ... handle other methods
```

### Security & Compliance Features

- **W3C Standards**: Full compliance with Payment Request API specification
- **RSA256 JWT**: Production-grade merchant authorization tokens for cart guarantees
- **PCI Ready**: Compatible with PCI-compliant card processing integration
- **Secure Keys**: Automatic RSA keypair generation and secure storage in `./keys/`
- **Multi-Processor**: Works with Stripe, Square, PayPal, and crypto networks

### Payment Method Configuration

#### Environment Setup for Production
```bash
# For production payment processing, configure these environment variables:

# Traditional Payment Processors
export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_live_..."           # For card processing
export STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_live_..."     # For frontend integration
export PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID="your_paypal_client"    # For PayPal integration
export PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET="your_paypal_secret"

# Google/Apple Pay (Production)
export GOOGLE_PAY_MERCHANT_ID="your_merchant_id"
export APPLE_PAY_MERCHANT_ID="merchant.your.app"

# Crypto Networks
export BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL="https://sepolia.base.org/..."
export ETHEREUM_RPC_URL="https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/..."
```

#### Payment Method Selection Logic
```python
# Smart payment method selection based on user preference and availability
def select_optimal_payment_method(user_preference, amount, currency):
    available_methods = agent.get_supported_payment_methods()
    
    # Priority order based on fees and speed
    if user_preference == "crypto" and "https://chaoschain.com/crypto-pay" in available_methods:
        return "https://chaoschain.com/crypto-pay"  # Lowest fees
    elif user_preference == "instant" and "https://google.com/pay" in available_methods:
        return "https://google.com/pay"  # Fastest for mobile
    elif currency == "USD" and "basic-card" in available_methods:
        return "basic-card"  # Most universal
    else:
        return available_methods[0]  # Fallback to first available
```

#### Error Handling Best Practices
```python
def robust_payment_processing(payment_method, amount, currency, payment_data):
    try:
        if payment_method == "https://chaoschain.com/crypto-pay":
            result = agent.execute_x402_crypto_payment(...)
        else:
            result = agent.execute_traditional_payment(
                payment_method, amount, currency, payment_data
            )
        
        if result.status == "completed":
            return {"success": True, "transaction_id": result.transaction_id}
        else:
            # Handle pending/failed states
            return {"success": False, "error": "Payment processing failed"}
            
    except Exception as e:
        # Fallback to alternative payment method
        fallback_methods = [m for m in agent.get_supported_payment_methods() 
                           if m != payment_method]
        if fallback_methods:
            return robust_payment_processing(fallback_methods[0], amount, currency, payment_data)
        else:
            return {"success": False, "error": str(e)}
```

## Triple-Verified Stack Integration

ChaosChain's revolutionary **Triple-Verified Stack** combines three verification layers for complete AI agent trust:

### AP2 Intent Verification (Layer 1)
**What it verifies:** "Did the human authorize this action?"
- **Cryptographic Mandates**: Intent and Cart verification with user signatures
- **Verifiable Credentials**: Tamper-proof authorization proofs
- **Multi-Protocol Support**: Universal payment authorization across different settlement methods

### ChaosChain Process Integrity (Layer 2)
**What it verifies:** "Did the agent execute the correct code?"
- **Code Hash Verification**: Cryptographic proof of function integrity
- **Execution Proofs**: Verifiable proof of correct code execution
- **Insurance Backing**: Economic consequences for agent deviation
- **Autonomous Operation**: Agents acting on their own behalf with verifiable behavior

### ChaosChain Adjudication (Layer 3)
**What it verifies:** "Was the work the agent did actually good?"
- **ERC-8004 Validation**: On-chain quality assessment and reputation
- **Quality Metrics**: Comprehensive scoring against domain-specific criteria
- **Reputation Building**: Long-term trust accumulation through verified work history

### Production-Ready Architecture

#### Security & Cryptography
- **RSA256 JWT Signing**: Enterprise-grade JWT tokens with 2048-bit RSA keys
- **Secure Key Management**: Automatic RSA keypair generation and secure storage in `./keys/`
- **Google AP2 Compliance**: Official library integration with W3C Payment Request API standards
- **Cryptographic Verification**: Public key verification for all JWT tokens

#### Configuration & Deployment
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Environment-aware configuration with `config/production.json`
- **Feature Toggles**: Enable/disable AP2, x402, IPFS, and other features dynamically
- **Multi-Network Support**: Base Sepolia, Base Mainnet, Ethereum, Polygon
- **Environment Variables**: Secure API key management with environment substitution

#### A2A-x402 Dual Payment System
- **Google AP2 Authorization**: User intent verification and payment authorization ($2.0 USDC) with JWT tokens
- **A2A-x402 Settlement**: Crypto settlement per Google's specification (1.7 USDC net, 2.5% to treasury)
- **Automatic Fee Collection**: Protocol fees collected transparently to ChaosChain treasury
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Payment receipts with cryptographic proofs integrated into evidence packages

### Revenue Model
- **Protocol Fees**: 2.5% of all x402 settlements go to ChaosChain treasury
- **Sustainable Economics**: Revenue scales with network usage and verification volume
- **Triple Value Capture**: Fees from intent verification, process integrity, and adjudication services
